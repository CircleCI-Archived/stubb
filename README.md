## Installing

### Debian Package (.deb) Instructions

Download the `.deb` file to the desired system.

For graphical systems, you can download it from the [GitHub Releases page][gh-releases].
Many distros allow you to double-click the file to install.
Via terminal, you can do the following:

```bash
wget https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/stubb/releases/download/v0.1.0/stubb_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i stubb_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

`0.1.0` and `amd64` may need to be replaced with your desired version and CPU architecture respectively.

### Linux Snap

More instructions coming soon.

### macOS / Brew

More instructions coming soon.


## Configuring

Most commands don't need authentication.
Some, such as `stubb set description`, require Docker / Docker Hub credentials.
These can be set via the environment variables `DOCKER_USER` and `DOCKER_PASS`.


## Features

*Lists* - List images belonging to a namespace and tags belonging to an image.

*Metadata* - Set your image's Docker Hub description from the command-line.
